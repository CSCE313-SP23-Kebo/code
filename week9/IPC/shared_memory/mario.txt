Hola Mundoo Bros, solo players pilot Mario, and an additional player can play as Luigi. The game is based on a series of side-scrolling levels, each filled with enemies ranging from mushroomlike Goombas to evil turtles known as Koopa Troopas. The levels take place in different settings, some in dungeons and some above ground, with fights against Bowser impersonators at the end of castle levels. Once the imposter is defeated, a Mushroom Kingdom resident informs Mario or Luigi that the princess is in another castle. The game is completed with the defeat of the true Bowser and the rescue of Princess Toadstool.
