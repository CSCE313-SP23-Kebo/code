/*
This example shows a signal handler that catches either of the two user-defined signals and prints the signal number.
We invoke the program in the background and use the kill(1) command to send it signals.
The kill(1) command and the kill(2) function just send a signal to a process or process group. Whether that signal terminates the process depends on which signal is sent and whether the process has arranged to catch the signal.
